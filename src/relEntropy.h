//It does this by decomposing the image into tiles of a given size (1x1, 2x2, 3x3 or 4x4). Only tiles internal to the image are used
//A basic algorithm evaluates the number of times each tile is repeated to determine the probability of a certain event.
//An event is a particular distribution of pixels in the tile. Subsequently, the entropy equation according to Shannon is applied.
//In this algorithm, a couple of differentiated actions are proposed:
// 1) Tiles without pixels are now considered non-repeated tiles (exclusive or with a unique code in the image)
// 2) The tiles considered noisy, although they may be repeated, also add to the list of exclusive tiles
//With these actions you achieve:
// a) eliminate the non-monotonicity presented by Shannon entropy,
// b) the possibility of analyzing images with low pixel concentrations
// c) considerable insensitivity to noise in the image
//The entropy value is relativized to the maximum possible value.
    
//NOTE: before using the class, the setRecBaseBinaryImage(IMAGE_ENTROPY *image_p) function must be called with a particular image
//is the image that will serve as a basis to know the area of interest on which the tiles will be displayed
